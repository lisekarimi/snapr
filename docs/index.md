# üè∑Ô∏è {{ PROJECT_NAME_DISPLAY }}

**Multi-agent AI system built to find the best deals ‚Äî so you never overpay.**  
*Smart. Simple. Automatic.*

---

## ‚ú® Overview

{{ PROJECT_NAME_DISPLAY }} is an agentic AI system designed to scan, evaluate, and find the best online deals in real time. It uses several AI models and agents to forecast product prices, spot big discounts, and remove irrelevant deals ‚Äî so users only see what‚Äôs truly worth buying.

## üöÄ How It Works

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand the flow</summary>

  <p>1Ô∏è‚É£ Users select up to {{ MAX_CAT }} categories from a predefined list in a sleek Gradio interface.</p>

  <p>2Ô∏è‚É£ A <strong>DealScanner agent</strong> fetches products and uses OpenAI to select the 5 best deals, ensuring clarity in description and pricing.</p>

  <p>3Ô∏è‚É£ Descriptions are passed to three independent agent models, each operating separately:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A fine-tuned <strong>LLaMA LLM</strong></li>
      <li><strong>XGBoost</strong> with <strong>E5 embeddings</strong></li>
      <li>A <strong>RAG pipeline</strong> using <strong>E5 embeddings</strong> with <strong>ChromaDB</strong> and a frontier <strong>LLM model</strong></li>
    </ul>
  <p>The three agent predictions are combined by an <strong>ensemble agent</strong> using a <strong>linear regression model</strong> to produce the final estimated price.</p>

  <p>4Ô∏è‚É£ If the actual price is at least <strong>${{DEAL_THRESHOLD}} lower</strong> than the final estimated value, the deal is accepted.</p>

  <p>5Ô∏è‚É£ Accepted deals appear in a table with name, prices, discount, and link.</p>
