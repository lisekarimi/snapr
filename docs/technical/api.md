# 🔌 Internal API Integration

{{ PROJECT_NAME_DISPLAY }} relies on internal API calls to trigger remote AI agents hosted on **Modal** and **OpenAI**. These are not public endpoints but are securely invoked within the application backend.

---

## ⚙️ Modal API (Internal)

Each agent is implemented as a **Modal class** and invoked using `modal.Cls.from_name(...)`. For example:

```py linenums="1"
remote_ensemble = modal.Cls.from_name(APP_NAME, "EnsemblePricer")
result = remote_ensemble().price.remote(ft_pred, rag_pred, xgb_pred)
```
Modal handles GPU resource allocation and scalability automatically.

## 🧠 OpenAI API

OpenAI is used by two agents:

- `DealScannerAgent`: selects the top 5 deals from raw inputs, ensuring clear descriptions and explicit prices.
- `RAGPriceAgent`: estimates product prices after retrieving similar items from ChromaDB to provide contextual grounding.

---

## 🔐 Authentication

Access to external services requires the following environment variables, which should be defined in the `.env` file.

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `MODAL_TOKEN_ID`
- `MODAL_TOKEN_SECRET`

!!! note
    All API interactions are internal — there is no public REST or HTTP API exposed.
